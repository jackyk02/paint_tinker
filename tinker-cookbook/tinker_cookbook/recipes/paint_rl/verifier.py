"""Multimodal rewards (LLM-as-a-Verifier, LLM-as-a-Judge) and the held-out evaluator.

The policy writes code; the *reward* comes from a multimodal model that looks
at the rendered paintings. Two interchangeable training rewards share the
same model, thinking effort, token budget, client and concurrency, so a run
with one is directly comparable to a run with the other:

* :class:`PairwiseVerifier` — LLM-as-a-Verifier, built on
  ``llm_verifier.compare`` from the `llm-verifier` package
  (https://github.com/llm-as-a-verifier/llm-as-a-verifier). Every comparison
  shows the verifier two paintings and ONE criterion and asks for a letter
  grade A-T per painting; the grade is read as the *expectation over the
  verifier's token distribution* at each ``<score_X>`` tag, not as the sampled
  letter, so a 5% chance of "A" still moves the reward. Scores are averaged
  over criteria and ``n_evaluations`` repeats, odd repeats swapping the two
  paintings so positional bias cancels. A rollout group is scored with a full
  **round-robin tournament**: every unordered pair of compiled paintings is
  compared, so a painting's reward is its mean grade against every other
  painting in its group.

* :class:`AbsoluteJudge` — the LLM-as-a-Judge baseline: each painting is
  scored on its own, once, on a single overall criterion, as an integer 1-10
  read from the judge's reply. Paintings with the same integer get the same
  reward (and so the same advantage); how often the top of a group is tied is
  reported as ``scorer/top_tie``.

  Both rewards use ``thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small`` by default, reached
  through Tinker's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That endpoint returns token
  logprobs but does not support assistant prefill, so the verifier's client
  is set up to read the letter distribution from the model's own sampled
  score tags (the ``llm_verifier`` path for hosted APIs).

* :class:`HeldoutEvaluator` — the held-out yardstick: ``moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6``
  on Tinker's native sampler scores each held-out painting on its own, 0-10
  per criterion. It never trains anything; it gives every checkpoint of every
  run, verifier or judge, a score on one fixed scale.

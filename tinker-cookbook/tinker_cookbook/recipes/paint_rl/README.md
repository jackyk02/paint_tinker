# Paint with code: RL with a multimodal LLM-as-a-Verifier (and an LLM-as-a-Judge baseline)

Teach `thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small` to paint watercolors by writing
[p5.brush](https://github.com/acamposuribe/p5.brush) sketches. The policy writes
a JavaScript sketch, the sketch is rendered headlessly to a PNG, a multimodal
model scores the *image*, and group-centered rewards update the policy. The
task follows ["Training AI to Paint with Code"](https://surya.website/rling-qwen-to-paint-with-code).

The reward is where this recipe differs. That project scored each image on an
absolute 0-10 scale and found the scores compressed and training stalled.
Here, rewards come from
[LLM-as-a-Verifier](https://github.com/llm-as-a-verifier/llm-as-a-verifier):
pairwise comparisons on a fine-grained 20-letter scale, one narrow criterion
per call, repeated with the two image slots swapped, and aggregated over a
round-robin tournament within each rollout group. Each comparison is one
`llm_verifier.compare` call from the
[`llm-verifier`](https://pypi.org/project/llm-verifier/) package. Inkling-Small
is its own verifier: the same base model, sampled at thinking effort 0.2 ("low"), looks
at the two rendered paintings through its native image input.

`reward_mode=judge` swaps in the classic **LLM-as-a-Judge** baseline: the
same model at the same effort scores each painting on its own on the
verifier's three criteria, one call each, as an integer 1-5, and averages
them. Everything else (policy, prompts,
batch, reward weights, token budget, concurrency) is shared, so the two runs
differ only in how the paintings are scored.

| Role | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Policy | `thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small` | LoRA rank 32, `tml_v0` renderer, thinking effort 0.7, 8k token budget |
| Training reward, `verifier` | `thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small` | `llm_verifier.compare` over Tinker's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, thinking effort 0.2, token logprobs, pairwise round-robin tournament, 2 repeats |
| Training reward, `judge` | `thinkingmachines/Inkling-Small` | Same endpoint, thinking effort 0.2; absolute 1-5 per painting on each of the verifier's three criteria, averaged; 3 calls per painting |
| Held-out evaluator | `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` | Tinker's native sampler; separate from the reward and never trained against |

```

Defaults: 8 prompts x 5 rollouts per step, 200 steps, LoRA rank 32, learning
rate 4e-5. A checkpoint is saved every 5 steps and kept on Tinker indefinitely
(`checkpoint_ttl_seconds=None`; the cookbook default would expire periodic
checkpoints after 7 days); they are listed in `<log_path>/checkpoints.jsonl`.
`hyperparam_utils.get_lr` has no calibrated value for Inkling; 4e-5 worked
for the run in the top-level README, but sweep the learning rate and
the effort settings (`policy_effort`, `verifier.effort`, `judge.effort`) if
you change the model. Run-level knobs are in `train.py`; the reward-model and
evaluator defaults live once, in `verifier.py`'s `VerifierConfig`,
`JudgeConfig` and `EvaluatorConfig`, and are overridden with dotted names
(`verifier.n_evaluations=2`, `judge.max_concurrency=256`,
`evaluator.model_name=...`).

Throughput: the whole step is in flight at once. A verifier step is 8 groups
x 10 pairs x 3 criteria x 2 repeats = 480 calls, and the reward model's
concurrency (`verifier.max_concurrency`, `judge.max_concurrency`, default
1200) covers all of them with room to spare; rendering runs one step's 40 sketches at once
(`render_concurrency=40`, about 4 pages per headless browser); policy
sampling on Tinker is never throttled.

## The loop

1. **Prompt.** For example, `Paint a teal field of flowers on a rolling
   hillside in wet-on-wet watercolor wash.` Most of the pool (`prompts.py`)
   is subject x color x style: 43 subjects (flowers, still-life objects,
   scenes and two animals) in three difficulty tiers (a single subject, a
   subject in a setting, two elements in a spatial relation), 8 colors and 4
   styles that stay visually distinct at 448 px. Eight fully worded skill
   prompts test object counting, spatial relationships, shape and
   perspective (`Paint a blue vase to the left of a yellow teacup, in
   layered watercolor glazes.`); they name their own colors, so they are
   crossed with the styles only and make up about a tenth of training. The
   256 training prompts are balanced over subjects, colors and styles. The 50
   held-out prompts are spread over every subject and are never trained on. `prompts_test.py` pins the split. The system prompt allows a fixed list of
   about 20 brush calls and gives no API documentation; the original project
   found that a long API reference made the model call functions that don't
   exist.
2. **Sketch.** The policy replies with one `javascript` block that defines
   `setup()` on a 512x512 WEBGL canvas. The page renders one frame and stops
   the loop itself.
3. **Render.** `render.py` runs the sketch in a sandboxed headless Chromium
   (Playwright with SwiftShader WebGL), with p5 1.11.3 and p5.brush 1.1.4
   inlined, and reads the canvas back as a PNG. A sketch passes the compile
   gate if it throws no error, makes at least three distinct `brush.*`
   drawing calls, and paints a non-blank canvas.
4. **Score.** With the **verifier**, every unordered pair of the group's
   compiled paintings is compared once per criterion and repeat. A group of 5
   gives 10 pairs x 3 criteria x 2 repeats = 60 comparisons, and a
   painting's score is its mean grade across every comparison it appears in.
   With the **judge**, each compiled painting gets an integer score 1-5 on
   each of the same three criteria, one call each; its score is the mean,
   mapped to `(s - 1) / 4`. Paintings with equal scores get equal rewards, and
   so equal advantages. Either way, sketches that fail the compile gate score
   0 and are not scored.
5. **Update.** `reward = 0.05 * compiled + 0.05 * length_ok + 0.90 * score`.
   The reward is centered within each group and fed to an importance-sampling
   policy gradient (`tinker_cookbook/rl/train.py`).

Every rollout's JavaScript, PNG and raw response, plus every verifier score,
are saved under
`<log_path>/paintings/<split>/step_XXXX/<prompt id>/` and indexed in
`paintings/index.jsonl`.

## The reward is a distribution, not a letter

`llm_verifier.compare` reads the verifier's top 20 alternatives at the token
after each `<score_A>` and `<score_B>` tag, and the score is the
*expectation* of the grade under that distribution, not the letter that
happened to be sampled. A painting the verifier is torn on between "E" and
"G" scores between them, and a 5% chance of "A" still raises the reward.
Fine-grained scores like these are the reason the scale has 20 levels.

The verifier is called through Tinker's
[OpenAI-compatible endpoint](https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/tinker/compatible-apis/openai/),
which returns token logprobs but has no assistant prefill. `verifier.py`
therefore sets the client up for `llm_verifier`'s hosted-API path, which
reads the distribution from the score tags the model samples itself, rather
than its prefill path, which would score every comparison as a tie on this
endpoint.

With the default two repeats per criterion, the second repeat swaps the two
image slots, so each pair is judged once in each order and the verifier's
bias toward one position cancels out within each pair. The three criteria are scored separately: content fidelity
(every named element, count, position and shape), color and style fidelity,
and watercolor craft and composition.

## Verifier vs judge: ties

A judge scoring integers 1-5 often gives the best paintings in a group the same
score; tied paintings get the same advantage, so the update carries no signal
between them. `scorer/top_tie` is the fraction of groups (with at least two
compiled paintings) whose highest score is shared by more than one painting.
It is logged in both modes; the verifier's expected-grade scores rarely tie,
so the two runs' `env/all/scorer/top_tie` curves show how much of that signal
the judge loses.

## Held-out evaluation

Held-out evaluation runs in its own process, so it never blocks training and
training stays on-policy. A checkpoint is saved every 5 steps (kept on Tinker
indefinitely); `eval_checkpoints.py` follows `checkpoints.jsonl` and
evaluates the base model and each checkpoint on the 50 held-out prompts:
the policy samples 5 paintings per prompt, and Kimi-K2.6 scores them
(`eval_strong/score`). The evaluator is set in `eval_checkpoints.py`
(`evaluator.*`), not taken from the run, so verifier and judge runs are
measured on the same yardstick. The run's own reward model is skipped there
unless `with_reward=True`. Results go to `<log_path>/heldout_eval/`; already
evaluated steps are skipped, so the evaluator can be restarted. `eval_every`
in `train.py` (default 0) still runs the same evaluation inline if you prefer.

Kimi's scores never enter the reward. The verifier's reward is relative to
the other paintings in a group, and the judge's is on its own scale, so
neither can be compared across steps or runs; the Kimi score is the fixed
yardstick. Kimi is asked exactly what the judge is asked: an integer 1-5 on
each of the verifier's three criteria, one call each, read from its reply;
a painting's score is the mean, mapped to `(s - 1) / 4` (750 calls per
checkpoint; `evaluator.criteria='("Overall Quality",)'` scores one overall
criterion instead). Kimi
runs on Tinker's native sampler through the cookbook's `kimi_k26` renderer,
because Tinker's OpenAI-compatible endpoint takes no images for it. A call
that fails after the SDK's retries is left out (`eval_strong/failed_frac`).
Another vision model on Tinker can be swapped in with
`evaluator.model_name=...` (and `evaluator.renderer_name=...` if `model_info`
has no renderer for it).

Useful metrics in `metrics.jsonl`:

- `env/all/reward/compile_ok`: compile gate pass rate.
- `env/all/reward/score_if_compiled`: reward-model score of compiled paintings.
- `env/all/scorer/top_tie`: fraction of groups whose top score is tied.
- `env/all/scorer/failed_frac`: reward-model calls that failed, ran out of tokens or gave no parseable score (scored as 0.5); should stay near 0.
- `test/env/all/eval_strong/score` (in `heldout_eval/metrics.jsonl`): Kimi's held-out score, the headline number.
- `test/env/tier3/...`, `test/env/skill/...`: held-out metrics broken out by tier and by subject family (`flower`, `object`, `scene`, `animal`, `skill`).

## Results

An earlier version of the recipe (a different prompt pool, 8 x 5 per step,
held-out prompts scored by Gemini) raised the held-out score from 3.24 to
5.35 out of 10 by step 470 and the held-out compile rate from 76% to 100%.
Those numbers are not comparable with the current defaults. Curves, example paintings and that run's metrics are in the
[top-level README](https://github.com/jackyk02/paint_tinker#results).

## Rendering on Modal

`render_backend=modal` sends each page to a Modal function instead of a local
browser (`render_modal.py`), for machines without Chromium. Deploy it once with
`modal deploy tinker_cookbook/recipes/paint_rl/render_modal.py`. On a machine
with many cores, local rendering is faster.

"""Policy system prompt and the painting-prompt dataset.

The system prompt follows the lesson from the "paint with code" project:
a short, strict allowlist of brush calls constrains the model better than a
long API reference (which mostly produced hallucinated APIs).

The prompt pool is ``subject x color x style``. It is built so the verifier
has something to resolve:

* **Subjects are what watercolorists commonly paint**: flowers, still-life
  objects, scenes and a few animals, in three difficulty tiers: tier 1 a single
  subject, tier 2 a subject in a setting, tier 3 two named elements in a
  spatial relation. A vague flower is the easiest blob to pass off, so the
  prompt-adherence criterion asks for an unmistakable, specific depiction.
* **Colors and styles are visually separable** at 448 px (no golden/ochre,
  no rose-pink/coral/crimson, no loose/splashy/wet-on-wet near-synonyms), so
  the color- and style-fidelity criteria score signal rather than noise.
* **A few skill prompts.** Eight fully worded requests test object counting,
  spatial relationships, shape and perspective (``SKILL_PROMPTS``). They name
  their own colors, so each is crossed with the four styles only, and they
  make up about a tenth of training; the rest is the simple subject base.
* **Held-out prompts, not held-out subjects.** The held-out set is a sample
  of the whole pool spread over every subject, color, style and tier; its
  exact prompts never appear in training, but every subject does. Training
  prompts are balanced over subjects so no subject is memorized more than
  another.

The split is deterministic in the seed and pinned by ``prompts_test.py``: a
change to the pool that moves the held-out set fails the test on purpose.

SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a generative artist who paints watercolors with code, using p5.js and the p5.brush library.

Write ONE complete JavaScript sketch that paints the requested subject. Reply with a single ```javascript code block and nothing else.

Hard rules:
- Define `function setup()` only. No draw() loop, no async code, no images, fonts, fetch, DOM, or external files.
- setup() must start with exactly: createCanvas({size}, {size}, WEBGL); angleMode(DEGREES); background(<paper color>); brush.load();
- WEBGL coordinates: (0, 0) is the CENTER of the canvas. x and y run from -{half} to {half}; y grows downwards.
- Use ONLY these brush functions (any other brush.* call throws and the painting is lost):
    brush.pick(name)                 name in "2B","HB","2H","cpencil","pen","rotring","spray","marker","marker2","charcoal"
    brush.stroke(css_color)  brush.noStroke()  brush.strokeWeight(multiplier)
    brush.fill(css_color, opacity_0_to_255)  brush.noFill()
    brush.bleed(strength_0_to_0.5, "out" or "in")  brush.fillTexture(texture_0_to_1, border_0_to_1)
    brush.line(x1, y1, x2, y2)  brush.circle(x, y, radius)  brush.rect(x, y, w, h)
    brush.polygon([[x, y], ...])  brush.spline([[x, y], ...], curvature_0_to_1)
    brush.beginShape(curvature_0_to_1); brush.vertex(x, y); ...; brush.endShape(CLOSE)
    brush.hatch(spacing, angle_degrees)  brush.noHatch()
    brush.field(name)                name in "curved","truncated","zigzag","seabed","waves"   brush.noField()
    brush.push()  brush.pop()  brush.seed(number)
- List the vertices of every filled shape CLOCKWISE, otherwise the watercolor bleed inverts.
- Plain p5 helpers are fine for maths and color: random, noise, sin, cos, map, lerp, constrain, color, lerpColor, PI.

Painting advice: build the image from several translucent washes (fill opacity 40-120 with bleed 0.1-0.4), let colors overlap and pool, vary edge softness, keep pencil or marker outlines sparse and broken, and fill most of the canvas with a clear, recognizable subject.
